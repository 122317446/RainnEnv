Project: Rainn – Guided AI Agent Builder
Student: Karl Concha (122317446)
Supervisor: Mr. Bill Emerson
Iteration: 2 (21/11/2025)

Purpose:
This README identifies the origin of all code used in Iteration 2 of Rainn and
confirms compliance with UCC’s FYP guidelines on third-party code, licensing, and AI usage.

------------------------------------------------------------
CODE ORIGIN SUMMARY
------------------------------------------------------------

Own Code – 30%
    • Implementation of the new Template Creation workflow (Input → Process → Output).
    • Flask routing for multi-step template submission.
    • Updates to the SQLite schema to store template fields.
    • Integration of Jinja value-passing and field validation.
    • Project clean-up and removal of redundant Iteration 1 files:
        - add_agent.html
        - update_agent.html
        - update_stage.html
        - agent_service.py


ChatGPT / AI Assistance – 60%
    • Help with reorganising HTML layout and refining Bootstrap structure.
    • Refining of routing for proper and correct flow with easy traceback
    • Debugging schema mapping and template-field routing issues.
    • Prompts used (examples):
        - “Show an example of a multi-step form in Flask.”
        - “Can you refine my HTML page to be kept simple and no redundant lines used.”
        - “Help clean up and simplify my Flask routes.”

External Sources – 10%
    • Flask Documentation – https://flask.palletsprojects.com
    • Bootstrap 5 Documentation – https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/
    • GitHub Repository – https://github.com/122317446/RainnEnv

------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES ON USAGE
------------------------------------------------------------

- All code was developed and tested locally on macOS using Python 3 (Flask) and SQLite.
- No proprietary or paid software was used.
- ChatGPT was used only as a coding aid (not for documentation). 
  All AI-assisted code was reviewed, modified, and understood before use.
- Version control managed through GitHub repository above.
- Iteration 2 focused on implementing the agent process / flow creation system properly (early build)
  prior to integrating the AI models.
