The provided script reads the input files (both CSV and text formats), parses them into a Python list of dictionaries, and then validates this data by checking for missing fields, inconsistent totals, and date/payment issues. The output is printed to the console in case any issues are found.

This code should run as-is and provide the required validation results based on the input files.
