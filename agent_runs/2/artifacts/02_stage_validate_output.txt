Here's a Python script that validates the parsed data and checks for missing fields, inconsistent totals, and date/payment issues:

```python
def validate_data(data):
    # Check if all required fields are present in each invoice
    for invoice in data:
        required_fields = ['Supplier', 'InvoiceNumber', 'InvoiceDate', 'DueDate', 'Subtotal', 'Tax', 'Total', 'Currency', 'PO', 'PaymentTerms']
        missing_fields = [field for field in required_fields if field not in invoice]
        if missing_fields:
            print(f"Missing fields: {missing_fields} in invoice with InvoiceNumber: {invoice['InvoiceNumber']}")

    # Check if totals are consistent
    for invoice in data:
        total = invoice['Subtotal'] + invoice['Tax']
        if abs(total - invoice['Total']) > 0.01:  # Allow a small margin of error due to floating point precision issues
            print(f"Inconsistent totals: InvoiceNumber {invoice['InvoiceNumber']} has Total {invoice['Total']} but calculated total is {total}")

    # Check for date/payment issues
    for invoice in data:
        try:
            invoice_date = datetime.strptime(invoice['InvoiceDate'], '%Y-%m-%d')
            due_date = datetime.strptime(invoice['DueDate'], '%Y-%m-%d')
            if due_date < invoice_date:
                print(f"Invalid dates: Due date is before Invoice date for invoice with InvoiceNumber: {invoice['InvoiceNumber']}")
        except ValueError:
            print(f"Invalid dates: Unable to parse dates for invoice with InvoiceNumber: {invoice['InvoiceNumber']}")

# Execute the function to validate data
data = parse_files()
validate_data(data)
```

This script checks if all required fields are present in each invoice, verifies that totals are consistent (allowing a small margin of error due to floating point precision issues), and ensures that dates are valid.

When you run this script with the parsed data from the previous stage, it should output any missing fields, inconsistent totals, or date/payment issues found in the input data.
