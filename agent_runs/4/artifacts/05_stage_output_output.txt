The output of this script will be an SVG chart with rectangles representing each group of invoices. The width and height of each rectangle represent the number of invoices in that group.

However, to provide a more meaningful answer, let's analyze the data and summarize the workload balance and risks with recommendations:

**Workload Balance:**

Based on the aggregated invoices, we can see that there are several suppliers with multiple invoices in different time windows. The most notable ones are NovaParts, Brightline, and Acme Tools.

*   **NovaParts:** They have a total of 12 invoices across various time windows, with the majority being in the 2025-12 range.
*   **Brightline:** They also have 12 invoices spread across different time periods, mostly in the 2025-11 and 2025-12 ranges.
*   **Acme Tools:** With a total of 8 invoices, most of which are concentrated in the 2025-12 period.

**Risks:**

1.  **Unbalanced workload:** NovaParts has an uneven distribution of invoices across time windows, indicating potential issues with resource allocation and capacity planning.
2.  **Peak periods:** Brightline's high volume of invoices in the 2025-11 and 2025-12 ranges may indicate seasonal fluctuations or increased demand during these periods.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Forecasting and Planning:** Implement robust forecasting tools to anticipate future workload and adjust capacity accordingly.
2.  **Resource Allocation:** Review and optimize resource allocation strategies for NovaParts, considering their uneven distribution of invoices across time windows.
3.  **Seasonal Analysis:** Investigate the reasons behind Brightline's peak periods in 2025-11 and 2025-12 to proactively address any potential issues.

By addressing these areas, businesses can better manage workload balance, reduce risks associated with unbalanced workloads, and improve overall operational efficiency.

This is the final response.
