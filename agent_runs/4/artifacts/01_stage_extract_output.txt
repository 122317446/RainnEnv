It appears that you have a large number of files in different formats (CSV, TXT) containing invoices for various suppliers and customers. The task is to perform some operation on these files, but I'm not sure what exactly.

However, based on the instruction "Perform ONLY this stage," it seems like we are only supposed to format the output of each file, without performing any actual calculations or data manipulation. 

If that's correct, I can provide a script in Python that reads each file and outputs its contents in a consistent format, which would be suitable as input for the next stage.

Here is an example code snippet:
```python
import csv

# Define a function to process each file
def process_file(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        if filename.endswith('.csv'):
            reader = csv.DictReader(f)
            rows = []
            for row in reader:
                rows.append({
                    'Supplier': row['Supplier'],
                    'InvoiceNumber': row['InvoiceNumber'],
                    'InvoiceDate': row['InvoiceDate'],
                    'DueDate': row['DueDate'],
                    'Subtotal': float(row['Subtotal']),
                    'Tax': float(row['Tax']),
                    'Total': float(row['Total']),
                    'Currency': row['Currency'],
                    'PO': row['PO'],
                    'PaymentTerms': row['PaymentTerms']
                })
        elif filename.endswith('.txt'):
            with open(filename, 'r') as f:
                lines = f.readlines()
                rows = []
                for line in lines:
                    if line.startswith('Supplier: '):
                        supplier = line[10:].strip()
                    elif line.startswith('InvoiceNumber: '):
                        invoice_number = line[14:].strip()
                    elif line.startswith('InvoiceDate: '):
                        invoice_date = line[13:].strip()
                    elif line.startswith('DueDate: '):
                        due_date = line[9:].strip()
                    elif line.startswith('Subtotal: '):
                        subtotal = float(line[10:])
                    elif line.startswith('Tax: '):
                        tax = float(line[6:])
                    elif line.startswith('Total: '):
                        total = float(line[7:])
                    elif line.startswith('Currency: '):
                        currency = line[11:].strip()
                    elif line.startswith('PO: '):
                        po = line[4:].strip()
                    elif line.startswith('PaymentTerms: '):
                        payment_terms = line[14:].strip()
                rows.append({
                    'Supplier': supplier,
                    'InvoiceNumber': invoice_number,
                    'InvoiceDate': invoice_date,
                    'DueDate': due_date,
                    'Subtotal': subtotal,
                    'Tax': tax,
                    'Total': total,
                    'Currency': currency,
                    'PO': po,
                    'PaymentTerms': payment_terms
                })
        # Add code to process other file formats if needed
    return rows

# Process each file and output the results
for i in range(1, 31):
    filename = f'invoice_sample_{i}.csv' if i <= 20 else f'invoice_sample_{i}.txt'
    print(process_file(filename))
```
This script assumes that all CSV files have a specific header row and that all TXT files follow the format specified in your example. 

You can adjust this code to better suit your needs, but it should give you an idea of how to process each file and output its contents in a consistent format.
