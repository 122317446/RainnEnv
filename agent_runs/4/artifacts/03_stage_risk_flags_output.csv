Based on the provided input, I will now conduct the Risk Flags stage.

**RISK FLAGS OUTPUT**

The validation output indicates that all required fields are present and consistent totals have been confirmed. However, a line item review has not been conducted yet, which may reveal potential compliance risks or late-payment concerns.

**LIST OF COMPLIANCE RISKS OR LATE-PAYMENT CONCERNS WITH SHORT REASONS:**

1. **Line Item Review Pending**: Further analysis of the invoice's line items is necessary to identify any discrepancies or non-compliance issues.
2. **Potential Tax Discrepancy**: Although the provided totals appear consistent, a detailed review of the line items may reveal potential tax discrepancies.
3. **Late Payment Concern**: The Due Date (2026-01-29) is approaching, and payment terms are Net 30, which may pose late-payment risks if not addressed promptly.

**RISK FLAG STATUS:**

* Severity: Medium
* Urgency: High

The output from this stage will now be passed on to the next stage, Graph.
