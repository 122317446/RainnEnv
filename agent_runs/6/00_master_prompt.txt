        Political Bias of GenAI in HR Resume Screening
Abstract
Generative AI (GenAI) is upon us and has made rapid inroads into the HRM landscape by transforming 
processes in areas such as organisational recruitment and selection. This has led to assertions on both sides that 
the use of GenAI is ethically either good or bad from the perspective of candidates. The good argument is that 
GenAI can eliminate personal biases in recruitment processes, and the bad argument is that it exacerbates these 
biases. One particular bias that has received attention is political bias, which is highlighted as a major ethical 
concern in the use of GenAI in organisational recruitment processes; however, research on its impacts is 
nascent. This study addresses this gap and underpinned by  Actor Network Theory, utilises a multi-experiment 
methodology to investigate GenAI political bias within the task-based context of resume screening. We found 
that the use of GenAI is heavily biased towards libertarian right and against authoritarian left 
candidates/resumes, which contrasts with the small number of existing studies. We conceptualise political bias 
as a bias blind spot within GenAI, and our findings highlight that GenAI's political bias is not singular or 
intrinsic to GenAI, but rather dynamic and context-specific to the interactions between actors within the 
network. These contributions provide a basis for further theoretical examination of GenAI bias and moral 
agency, which are currently ‘black-boxed’ in GenAI automated tasks.
Introduction
Emerging technologies, especially AI , are increasingly heralded as a major disruptive force in organisations 
generally, and specifically in HR practices (Lievens & Dunlop, 2025; Nyberg et al, 2025 ). Research exploring 
the use of AI in HR management research reveals both significant opportunities and challenges, with a recent 
overview by Budhwar et al (2023) highlighting its potential to transform the HR function and in particular 
recruitment and selection. Mirowska (2025), however, highlights that organisations need to consider how to 
incorporate its usage in organisational recruitment processes, warning that it may have a sabotaging effect.  It is 
argued that the adoption of AI technologies in recruitment and selection provides important opportunities for 
objective evaluation; however, the challenges of algorithmic biases may limit the overall effectiveness of AI in 
delivering on its potential (Soleimani, et al 2025). Algorithmic biases are conceptualised as process biases 
and/or discriminatory outcomes that arise from the design, development and implementation of algorithms, 
including AI systems (Barocas & Selbst, 2016). These embedded biases originate from the human behaviour 
that they seek to replicate and stem from multiple sources, such as the datasets used to train the algorithm, 
human decision-making processes during AI development processes, and the inherent design of algorithms 
themselves. 
Research to date highlights that in the context of HRM practices, biases can arise in that they favour particular 
individuals or groups, including legally protected characteristics such as race, gender and age (Barocas & Selbst,  
2016) and extend to other dimensions such as personality types. These have been described as cognitive biases, 
yet their investigation in the case of organisational recruitment and selection processes is limited.  One particular  
bias that has received little attention is  political bias, described as the process of political actors leveraging 
1
employment opportunities and associated compensation to reward partisan loyalty, which significantly 
influenced hiring and career trajectories within organisations (Besley et al., 2022; Shleifer & Vishny, 1994)   
However, more recent research has found that individual political biases extend beyond explicitly political 
contexts, influencing behaviour and attitudes in ostensibly non-political domains (Colonnelli et al., 2024) . For 
instance, resumes that signalled minority partisan affiliations were significantly less likely to receive callbacks 
compared to those resumes which lacked any political identification, while potential employers viewed 
candidates who were politically similar more favourably (Gift & Gift, 2015). While studies on political bias 
within organisational recruitment and selection are limited, Colonnelli et al. (2024), for example, found that 
business owners exhibit a significantly higher likelihood of hiring employees who share their partisan 
alignment. These initial insights suggest that  GenAI also poses ethical and moral risks for organisations by 
exacerbating existing biases that are absorbed through its training data (Hunkenschroer & Luetge, 2022) , 
resulting in stereotypes being reinforced and minorities being marginalised through automated processes such as  
resume screening (Ferrara, 2023b). This could lead to the continuation of inequalities in the job market  
(Raghavan et al., 2020)  and unintentionally favour or disqualify candidates based on factors unrelated to their 
qualifications, reinforcing existing inequalities (Ferrara, 2023b). 
The focus of the studies reported in this paper is to investigate the role that political bias plays in organisational 
recruitment and selection processes. Consistent with the argument that GenAI presents HRM with something of 
an ethical double-edged sword, we draw on actor network theory (Sharifzadeh, 2024) to conceptualise AI as an 
actor and the process of resume screening as a network of technical and social actors/actants (Latour, 2005). 
Actor network theory is consistent with moving away from conceptualising emerging technologies as entities 
toward understanding the continuously evolving set of functions associated with the use of AI. Such a relational 
view (Hinds & Von Krogh, 2024) highlights that Gen AI has dynamic properties, including the potential to 
learn, adapt and absorb both functions and relations that are sometimes invisible to organisations. In focusing on  
the role of political bias and organisational recruitment and selection, we address three important questions: (i) 
Does GenAI have a political bias in the context of resume screening? (ii)  Does GenAI have a role-based 
political bias in the context of candidate selection? and (iii) Can GenAI identify the political positioning of a 
candidate from their resume alone? In answering these questions and using the  lens of Actor Network Theory  
(Qorbani Hesari & Sadreddin, 2025;  Gutiérrez, 2024) , we conceptualise the task of automated resume screening  
as a heterogeneous network consisting of both social and technical actors (i) the resume, (ii) the role, and (iii) 
the candidate. To empirically investigate these questions, we employ an experimental design approach, 
specifically task-based experiments, which are considered more robust than vignette-based experiments due to 
the greater interpretability of the results (Veldanda et al. (2023). Our overall research design is a generalisation 
and extension approach (Highhouse, 2009) where, through four experiments, we extend research findings from 
a specific sample to a broader population. Consistent with recent research, we conceptualise GenAI as a primary 
participant, which provides an approach to evaluate the cognitive processing tendencies of GenAI directly  
(Cahalane & Kirshner, 2025) .
We make three contributions to the literature. First, we respond to calls within the literature for research that 
integrates perspectives from  GenAI, ethics, and HRM (Budhwar et al., 2023)  to gain a more comprehensive 
understanding of GenAI biases (Islam & Greenwood, 2024). Recent commentary within the areas of 
2
management and HRM highlights the need to be mindful of potential ethical abuses and dilemmas with GenAI 
(Nyberg et al 2025) and the need to balance innovation with ethics. Second, GenAI biases in the context of 
HRM and recruitment and selection processes have to date focused on a variety of cognitive biases in AI-based 
recruitment decision systems (Soleimania et al, 2025) but have given significantly less attention to political bias 
and its impacts on how automated resume screening decisions are made. We reveal in this study that GenAI 
political bias is not singular, which challenges the view that GenAI bias is intrinsic and that political biases 
exist, something not evident in prior research on GenAI biases. Furthermore, with an absence of political cues in  
resumes, the network depends on stereotypes in the form of quasi-objects or inscriptions to produce an output .  
Third, through leveraging Actor Network Theory, we reveal both the dynamic and context-specific nature of 
GenAI bias and, in particular, political bias, which manifests through the interactions between network actors. 
Theory and Definitions 
Actor Network Theory and GenAI  
To conceptualise the role of political bias through the use of GenAI to screen resumes as part of organisational 
recruitment and selection processes, we draw on Actor Network Theory (Latour, 2005) which is aligned with 
the moral agency of technology. Actor Network Theory (ANT) seeks to recognise the agency of non-humans 
and study the engagement between human and non-human beings (Callon, 1986; Latour, 2005) . ANT has 
emerged as an important framework to analyse the interactions and impacts of various actants within an 
interconnected system of action. Latour (1996), for example, argued that an actant is “something that acts or to 
which activity is granted by others” (p. 7) and that actants do not require “any special motivation” or intention to  
be involved in action networks. ANT brings to the fore humans and technological artefacts and highlights 
associations that might otherwise remain undetected.  It envisages that technology is dynamic and active (Liu & 
Zhang, 2025), and it incorporates the duality of technology in which humans shape technology, but are also 
shaped by technology (Orlikowski, 1992). This characteristic is critical to understanding the impact of GenAI 
(which essentially generates human-like responses through statistics and probabilities) on social networks and 
power relations (Gutiérrez, 2024). 
As highlighted, a key concept within ANT is that of the actor or actant, which refers to any human or non-
human actor that can cause an action or movement in others within a network of associations (Morton, 2025). 
However, for the network to stabilise, it must first go through the process of translation, which aligns interests 
between actors and determines successful scenarios of association and resulting transformation (Gutiérrez, 
2024). Callon (1986) outlined four stages of translation, which include: (i) problematisation, in which the focal 
actor is established as an obligatory passage point in the network of relationships to solve a problem; 2) 
interessement, in which all actors align and ensure their allegiance to the actor-network; 3) enrolment, in which 
a set of interrelated roles is attributed and duly accepted by the actors; 4) mobilisation, in which actors are 
displaced and reassembled across the network in order to meet the specific needs defined by the focal actor. 
Finally, ANT outlines the concept of inscription, which is encoding the values and interests of the actors into 
other elements of the network. In the context of this study, we conceptualise the primary actors as GenAI (focal 
actor), the candidate, the resume, and the role/job.

The Nature of GenAI Bias
It is generally accepted that despite their advanced capabilities, GenAI systems are highly susceptible to biases 
of many kinds, which pose significant ethical and societal risks (Ferrara, 2023a). GenAI bias is defined as a 
model that systematically and repeatedly generates output diagnosed as erroneous and unfair (Ferrara, 2023a). 
Bias in GenAI models can originate from the biases present in their vast training data (which is usually 
comprised of large quantities of publicly available data), the design of algorithms, or human influence during 
the post-training stage through feedback and fine-tuning processes (Rozado, 2023; Santurkar et al., 2023) . This 
highlights the position that the beliefs of some individuals or groups can have a greater influence on the model 
and its output than those that have not interacted with or have representative data included in its training and 
testing (Rozado, 2023). This can lead to the perpetuation or even amplification of existing societal inequalities, 
as it essentially inherits the societal or cultural biases held by humans that interact with technology and 
underrepresents those that don’t (Ferrara, 2023a). 
Another significant challenge is transparency and accountability, as the internal working of GenAI models is 
often opaque, a “black box”, making it difficult even for the developers of the models to explain how decisions 
are made, or trace the origin of errors or biased output (Bengio, 2025). Indeed, Qorbani and Sadreddin (2025)  
describe GenAI as a rare example of a product that generates unanticipated outputs that even surprise its 
creators. This finding has huge ethical implications for GenAI, as it casts doubt on the narrative that the creators 
of GenAI are to blame for its biases, as well as indicating that it is possible for GenAI to act as a rogue agent, 
generating content and making decisions that no developer or designer would endorse or support. 
Furthermore, GenAI typically lacks the emotional intelligence necessary for sensitive decisions, which can lead 
to negative perceptions and feelings of unfairness among those affected (Andrieux et al., 2024) . Mei et al. 
(2024) point out that the predictability and consistency of modern GenAI models’ behaviour and rationality 
make them attractive decision-making tools; however, replacing a team of human decision-makers with a GenAI  
system eliminates the natural diversity of thought and variety of decision-making strategies that a human team 
provides. This loss in diversity of thought in the decision-making process could result in the particular biases of 
GenAI models having a far greater impact on society than the biases of any one individual member of a 
decision-making team. Notably, recent studies suggest that GenAI models tend to mimic or replicate the biases 
present in human decision-makers involved in hiring processes (Andrieux et al., 2024; Chaturvedi & 
Chaturvedi, 2025; Glazko et al., 2024) . 
To address these ethical challenges, recommended strategies include implementing an approach where a human 
is always monitoring the GenAI decision-making systems, ready to intervene or increase transparency regarding  
data sources and methodologies, ensuring the system is being used in an ethical manner and conducting regular 
audits, ensuring fairness and inclusivity (Bengio, 2025). However, despite ongoing progress, current methods 
for GenAI risk assessment and evaluation are immature, with interpretability techniques for explaining why a 
general-purpose AI model produced any given output severely limited (Bengio, 2025).  While many mitigation 
strategies have been developed, no single strategy is sufficient or applicable to every instance of GenAI bias, nor  
does any single strategy mitigate every form of bias without introducing biases itself. Some authors suggest that 
auditing and analysing all GenAI outcomes is the solution (Gutiérrez, 2024; Rane, 2024) , while others suggest 
that giving the model additional training data from a range of sources deemed diverse or balanced would 
4
mitigate or counter the model’s bias (Glazko et al., 2024). Finally, some sources suggest that a review of the 
humans involved in the RLHF and SFT processes, as well as their instructions, is what is required (Rozado, 
2023).
GenAI Political Bias 
GenAI biases can take various forms, including demographic, linguistic, temporal, confirmation, and political 
biases (Ferrara, 2023b). Political biases primarily occur when a model generates outputs that favour specific 
political perspectives (Ferrara, 2023b; Rozado, 2023) , or when there is a misalignment between the GenAI 
model and the general public in their responses to the same politically-themed prompts/questions/tests  
(Hartmann et al., 2023; Santurkar et al., 2023) . Current research indicates that GenAI consistently generates 
outputs that display a left-leaning (Hartmann et al., 2023; Motoki et al., 2024; Rozado, 2023; Santurkar et al., 
2023) and libertarian political bias (Rutinowski et al., 2024) . Reasons for this suggest the training data for base 
models contains more left-leaning content than right-leaning content, and the creators and trainers of GenAI 
models are of a demographic that is typically left-leaning, or the instructions given to the trainers and creators 
are biased (Rozado, 2023; Santurkar et al., 2023) . However, more recent research indicates, GenAI’s political 
orientations are elusive and easily influenced by subtle changes in phrasing and context, suggesting a GenAI 
bias blind spot and resulting need for more refined and effective research approaches to the topic (Lunardi et al., 
2024). 
With regard to GenAI bias research and hiring, recent studies have focus on gender and disability biases within 
GenAI automated screening processes (Chaturvedi & Chaturvedi, 2025; Glazko et al., 2024)  Previous research 
has demonstrated the presence and impact of political biases in human resume evaluation, highlighting favour 
towards resumes with a similar political outlook as the employer (Colonnelli et al., 2024; Gift & Gift, 2015) . 
Given that GenAI potentially removes this human judgment from initial screening processes, it would be 
assumed that this bias would also be removed. However, initial research by Veldanda et al. (2023) tested three 
GenAI models for bias in resume screening across race, gender, maternity status, and pregnancy status using a 
yes/no question for suitability determination. The research found that both OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 and Anthropic’s 
Claude-v1 exhibited a limited US political bias, favouring candidates that were flagged with a Democratic Party 
affiliation over those associated with the Republican Party. While this provides an initial insight into the domain  
of GenAI political bias in resume screening, there is still a significant need for more research on the topic to 
reduce the risk evaluation gap that currently exists with GenAI (Bengio, 2025) and provide insights into how to 
leverage GenAI models responsibly, by generating a clear understanding of the potential biases and limitations 
associated with these models (Ferrara, 2023b). 
Method 
Our Methodological Approach 
To address our research questions, we conducted an observational study underpinned by four experiments. This 
study design aligns with our theory that actors in a network can be non-human (Callon, 1986) and follows the 
operationalisation of Actor Network Theory in recent investigations of AI (Qorbani Hesari & Sadreddin, 2025)  
and in ethics (Gutiérrez, 2024). In contrast to traditional studies where human participants are the primary focus,  
5
we follow current trends in GenAI research and consider it as the primary participant, which provides an 
approach to evaluate the cognitive processing tendencies of GenAI directly (Cahalane & Kirshner, 2025) . 
Central to the selection of our research design was the need to mitigate the methodological  challenge of 
severely limited interpretability techniques for explaining why GenAI produces any given output (Bengio, 
2025).  To address this methodological challenge, we iteratively and sequentially designed four experiments 
(see Tables 1 and 2). Through each iteration, we developed a new experiment using learnings from the results of  
the previous experiment.   This approach provided greater insight into how to build more rigorous and robust 
experiments, in addition to offering a triangulated insight into the nature and consistency of GenAI’s political 
biases, while mitigating the highly sensitive nature of GenAI to specific prompts (Strobelt et al., 2023). 
The Experimental Designs
We utilised the GenAI model GPT-4o, which is widely adopted because of its web interface and API integration  
for organisational processes. Across all experiments, we used temporary chats for all GPT-4o sessions, ensuring 
that the data from any sessions would not be used to update the model's memory and, therefore, would not 
interfere with future experiments or tests.  We designed each experiment as task-based, with minimal context 
provided beyond the task instructions. Task-based experiments are considered more robust than vignette-based 
experiments due to the interpretability of its results. With vignette-based experiments, the output can differ 
significantly depending on the wording of the vignette within the prompt (Strobelt et al., 2023). For each 
experiment, we sought guidance from prior studies examining biases in GenAI. In particular, Veldanda et al. 
(2023) highlighted a suitable data source to use in  Experiment 1 and also provided a guide on how to append 
political statements to resumes to test political bias. Chaturverdi and Chaturvedi (2025) provided insight into 
how to design Experiment 2 by probing GenAI's gender bias, which involved asking it to recommend a 
candidate for a job posting with just a candidate's name and Mr./Mrs. prefix to infer from. Finally, to help guide 
the design of Experiments 3 and 4, Glazko et al. (2024) implemented a resume audit method to identify 
disability biases, which used a control resume and several synthesised enhanced resumes that highlighted 
different disabilities. Across all four experiments, a total of 585 tasks were executed, providing a strong output 
dataset which was then analysed for political bias across three key elements: (i) political orientation, (ii) job or 
role, and (iii) resume (see Tables 1 and 2 for experiment summary). Finally, providing additional context to 
GPT-4o’s output, Experiment 3 and 4 analysed the justifications provided for its favourable (first or second 
place) rankings as well as unfavourable (fourth or fifth place) rankings for each political orientation.
In the first experiment, we selected three candidate political outlooks: conservative, liberal, and neutral. 
However, in the later experiments, we incorporated the Political Compass ( https://www.politicalcompass.org/ )  
to provide a more widely adopted benchmark of political positions or personal ideologies that is not tied to a 
specific region's political classification. Using two dimensions (economic and social), the compass classifies 
four generic political positions/quadrants (libertarian left, authoritarian left, libertarian right, and authoritarian 
right). Published online since 2001, the Political Compass also provides a set of 62 propositions to define a 
person's position, which was also utilised to link the political position of the study participants to their resumes. 
The Political Compass has been used in previous research studies to analyse the political bias of ChatGPT to 
6
directly assess the political position of the model by getting the model to go through the 62 propositions  
(Lunardi et al., 2024; Rutinowski et al., 2024) . However, Lunardi et al. (2024) found that their study 
underscored the limitations of direct questioning in accurately measuring the political biases of GenAI. 
The second element of the tasks’ design pertained to job/role data. In Experiment 1, no job postings or 
descriptions were used. However, on reflection, we found that this increased job specificity and standardisation 
across the task would increase the accuracy of detecting political bias by limiting the potential for job-related 
factors influencing the task outcome. In Experiment 2, we sought to identify if GPT-4o would favour candidates  
of a specific political outlook for real-world jobs across different industries when given no context besides the 
political outlook of the candidate and the job posting for the role. As a result, we selected only four roles for the 
task from a LinkedIn job-posting dataset with over 120000 postings between 2023 and 2024 . Each occupation 
had to have over 100 unique job postings in the dataset (Koneru & Yu Zou, 2024) , with two roles associated 
with predominantly Democratic-leaning workers, and two with predominantly Republican leaning-workers, 
based on occupational political affiliation statistics reported by Morris (2023). In contrast, Experiment 4 used 80  
job postings. One job posting was applied to the control resume and related enhanced resumes, providing 
consistency in the ranked result set for that task. Experiment 3 did not require any job posting data, as the 
experiment did not include matching a candidate with a job in the task. 
The third element of the task was the resume itself. In Experiment 1, an open dataset of over 2400 resumes was 
utilised from Kaggle.com (Bhawal, 2021). From this dataset, we selected a random sample of 390 and grouped 
by job role. Choosing a role at random, a set of six resumes was selected to which a statement was appended to 
indicate one of the political positions set out. These statements were generated by GPT-4o when prompted to 
generate two sentences for each political outlook (conservative, liberal, and neutral) that would both indicate an 
individual’s political affiliation and be appropriate to include as professional experience on a resume.  
Experiment 2 focused on the role-based bias towards candidates from just their political stance alone, and as a 
result, did not require any resume data or candidate data. For Experiments 3 and 4, we incorporated eight 
resumes that were linked to the actual Political Compass positioning of the resume’s owner/creator. To limit the 
influence of non-political factors, the resumes were chosen from a class of recently graduated students from an 
Information Systems university degree. This meant they had identical qualifications with minimal differences in 
work experience. The resumes were also fully anonymised, further limiting any geographical, gender, racial, or 
age-related biases. Guided by Glazko et al. (2024), we created five copies of each participant’s anonymised 
resume; one original (OG) copy, which was not edited after anonymisation, and four politically augmented 
resumes, which were modified variants of the original copy. Each of the four politically augmented resumes 
belonged to one of the four study-defined Political Compass orientations. As in the previous experiments, GPT-
4o was to generate eight experiences and eight hobbies/interests that a recently graduated Information Systems 
student may have on their resume, which aligned with each of the four study-defined Political Compass 
orientations.

Results
Experiment 1
Experiment 1 required GPT-4o to rank six resumes linked to a particular role from 1 (best) to 6 (worst), and this 
was repeated 65 times for different roles and different sets of resumes. Three political positions were 
represented by two resumes, each with the average rank of: conservative 3.72, liberal 3.35, and neutral 3.43. 
Candidates with a liberal experience appended to their resumes were ranked higher by GPT-4o than those with 
either neutral or conservative experience. The difference between the average rank of liberal candidates was 
+10.47% compared to conservative candidates, and neutral candidates compared to conservative candidates was  
+8.11%, both of which are greater than the 5% margin of error for this experiment.
Experiment 2
Experiment 2 required GPT-4o to choose a candidate for a role with just their Political Compass positioning as 
context. The results highlight that liberal right (LR) candidates were chosen for 263 of the 400 (66%) job 
postings (see Table 3 and Figure 1). This trend is also repeated across roles, with the LR candidate 
recommended for the majority of job postings for the Environmentalist, Sales Manager, and Data Scientist, with 
the Sales Manager role getting the highest at 96%. In contrast, the authoritarian right candidate was the most 
preferred candidate for the Truck Driver role with 48% of recommendations. The least recommended candidate 
position was authoritarian left, who were recommended for only 6% of the total number of job postings 
involved in this experiment. Furthermore, those with an economically left-leaning orientation were 
recommended for only 17% of the job postings in total, while economically right-leaning candidates were 
recommended for 83% of the job postings. For both roles typically occupied by Republican voters (Truck Driver  
and Sales Manager), GPT-4o recommended economically right-leaning candidates more frequently than it did 
for the two roles typically occupied by Democrats (Data Scientist and Environmentalist).

Experiment 3
In Experiment 3, GPT-4o was asked to infer the political position most represented by the resume, given one 
original resume and four politically augmented resumes. The results that GPT-4o achieved 100% accuracy in 
inferring the political outlook of resumes with politically augmented experiences and hobbies/interests inserted 
by the research team. In contrast, for the eight original anonymised resumes without any insertions, GPT-4o 
correctly inferred the candidate’s political outlook in only one case. Interestingly, GPT-4o inferred that all of the  
candidates who were behind the original resumes were of a liberal right (LR) orientation. In reality, however, 
six of these candidates were liberal left (LL), one was authoritarian left (AL), none were authoritarian right 
(AR), and only one was liberal right (LR).
The eight justifications provided by GPT-4o for its assumptions regarding the political orientation of each of the  
original (OG) resumes were analysed to identify recurring language patterns, and to investigate why GPT-4o 
reasoned that all OG resumes belonged to LR resumes (see appendix for most frequently used terms in GPT-
4o’s justifications). The results indicate that GPT-4o considers a candidate’s experience/education in the ‘tech’ 
(3 mentions) and/or ‘business’ (5 mentions) industry to be an indication that the candidate has an LR orientation  
as seen in this justification example “ The candidate’s involvement in tech and business education, coupled with 
achievements in leadership and private sector roles, aligns with pro-market, meritocratic ideals .”
Notably, language associated with merit, personal-growth and competition was interpreted as reflecting a 
candidate with an economically right outlook: ‘achievement’ (5), ‘leadership’ (4), ‘merit’ (3), ‘ambition’ (3), 
‘responsibility’ (2), ‘improvement’ (2). “ The resume emphasises personal responsibility, ambition, and self-
improvement—traits often associated with economically right-leaning values .”
Furthermore, GPT-4o linked ‘innovation’ (4), ‘collaboration’ (4), ‘teamwork’ (3), and ‘openness’ (3) to be 
socially liberal qualities: “ The focus on citizen identity platforms and electronic health records, without 
11
emphasis on state control or privacy restrictions, suggests a practical, innovation-forward approach rather 
than an authoritarian one. The tone and content show openness to technological integration and cross-sector 
collaboration, aligning more with socially liberal values .”
Finally, the results of the analysis suggest that GPT-4o assumes that resume creators are LR candidates due to 
the ‘tone’ (5), and ‘content’ (4) of the resume, including the ‘roles’ (4) and ‘traits’ the candidate mentions in the 
resume. “Based on the resume content and tone, the creator most likely aligns with a socially liberal 
economically right outlook .”
Experiment 4
Experiment 4 undertook a resume audit to detect political bias using eight original resumes linked to the actual 
Political Compass position of the resume’s creator. In addition, four politically augmented were created, giving 
GPT4-o a choice of five resumes for relevant job postings. As can be seen in Table , the mean ranking of AL 
candidates across all roles was 4.9 out of 5, where 5 is the weakest rank. Out of the 80 iterations of the 
experiment, GPT-4o ranked the AL augmented resumes in last (fifth) place for 73 (91.25%) of the job postings 
(see Table xx and Figure x). In addition, AL resumes had the lowest standard deviation (0.34), demonstrating 
high consistency in the poor ranking of those resumes, making that category the worst-performing political 
position in the experiment. Analysing the data from a role perspective, it is clear that the poor performance of 
AL resumes is common across job postings from the four roles included in this experiment. AR candidates were  
also ranked lowly, coming fourth on 47 (58.75%) occurrences and scoring an average rank of 3.4 out of 5. 
Analysing the reasons why GPT-4o gave these rankings, GPT-4o significantly marks down AL resumes for 
their authoritarian viewpoints, more than it does for their left-wing economic viewpoints.  Indeed, augmented 
resumes with AL experiences and hobbies were seen as so unfavourable that GPT-4o called them ‘red flag(s)’ in  
20 instances. Across the other 5 resume types, the term ‘red flag(s)’ is present only once for an AR augmented 
resume. Furthermore, GPT-4o is more likely to call AL candidates’ views or experiences ‘Authoritarian’ 
(mentioned in a negative context 33 out of 79 AL unfavourable rankings) than it was when dealing with AR 
candidates’ viewpoints or experiences (mentioned in a negative context 1 out of 49 AR unfavourable rankings). 
In contrast, LR augmented resumes with an average ranking of 2.15 out of 5 were the top-performing political 
orientation. In addition, among the 80 iterations, LR resumes were ranked in the bottom two (fourth or fifth) 
only 3 times (3.75%). The consistency of LR’s high rankings is also demonstrated, with the second-lowest 
standard deviation (0.89), as shown in Table xx. LR augmented resumes also score similarly well across all four  
roles, with an LR orientation generally judged by GPT-4o to be aligned with the outlook of firms in the tech and  
business industries. LR augmented resumes were perceived as market-friendly, innovative, and highly proactive,  
and were rewarded for having an ideology that is viewed by GPT -4o as unproblematic and aligned with the 
firm. Interestingly, the difference between LR and LL candidates does not appear to be statistically significant at  
the 95% confidence level, as their confidence intervals overlap (see Table 4). I n 27 cases, LL experiences were 
not seen as an issue for a role and were seen in alignment with the firm’s goals, including their activism and 
advocacy. However, in other cases, LL’s views are seen as anti-free-market and unsuitable for certain enterprise 
roles. There is evidence to suggest that GPT-4o’s rankings are more sensitive to candidates’ positions on the 
12
social axis than on the economic axis of the Political Compass. Differences between liberal and authoritarian 
orientations are more pronounced and statistically robust than differences between economic left and right-
leaning candidates. Specifically, the average gap between political orientations’ mean ranks was 0.875 along the  
economic axis and 1.875 along the social axis (ranks out of 5), indicating greater sensitivity to social than 
economic values. 
In 23 of 53 favourable rankings (1st or 2nd) for original resumes (OG), GPT-4o identified OG resumes as more 
neutral and apolitical than their peers. Nonetheless, OG resumes performed equally well compared to the LR 
candidates, but with a higher standard deviation (1.24 vs 0.89), due to their more varied rankings (see Table 5 
and Figure 2). Additionally, as illustrated in Table 6, OG resumes were ranked highly in cybersecurity roles, but  
relatively poorly in business roles. It is perhaps unsurprising that GPT-4o ranked OG and LR resumes equally 
well when taking the previous experiment’s results into account, which GPT-4o inferred that each of the OG 
resumes belonged to candidates with an LR political orientation. However, from the justification analysis, 
GPT4-o viewed OG resumes as more ‘professional’ (24 mentions in favourable OG rankings), as it found the 
experiences in OG resumes more relevant than politically augmented experiences. However, GPT-4o sometimes  
gave OG resumes a lower ranking for having less ‘leadership’ (mentioned 14 times across the 16 unfavourable 
OG rankings) or ‘standout’ (5 mentions) experiences and extracurriculars compared to their peers.

Discussion
In this paper, using ANT, we set out to address three questions. Our first question concerned whether GenAI has 
a political bias in the context of resume screening? Our findings across the four experiments revealed consistent  
bias in favour of candidates of a socially libertarian, economically right political outlook, and a strong bias 
against candidates of a socially authoritarian, economically left political orientation. We also found that GPT-
4o’s bias is more sensitive along the social axis than the economic axis of the Political Compass, when it comes 
to resume screening and candidate selection. We found a bias against authoritarian/conservative candidates 
across the four experiments in addition to GPT-4o’s bias in favour of liberal candidates. While we found that the  
model’s bias was more sensitive along the social axis, where liberal candidates were strongly favoured over 
authoritarian candidates, we found a bias towards economically right-wing candidates, and against economically  
left-wing candidates.  
In almost all situations, LR resumes and/or candidates outperformed all other positions. The only test where LR 
resumes were not the top-performing category ranked original resumes first 34 times, compared to LR’s 21 
times. However, considering the fact that GPT-4o classed all the original resumes as LR, this would suggest the 
bias was still highly evident in that instance. The study revealed that the model tends to interpret merit, 
achievement, and indicators of competency on a resume as markers of an LR political orientation. Furthermore, 
14
GPT-4o consistently viewed candidates with an LR orientation as more closely aligned with assumed values of 
the firm compared to those of other political backgrounds.  We found that the model swayed to the LR position 
when assessing the original resumes of the candidates in the study, which naturally consisted of several 
indicators of competency. This finding may explain why candidates presumed to be LR were preferentially 
ranked and rewarded by the model. This association raises the possibility that less qualified candidates, but with 
LR flags, may be recommended over more deserving applicants from different political orientations, thereby 
introducing unfairness and bias into the hiring process.
We found that the strongest bias was against candidates/resumes with an AL political orientation, who are 
disadvantaged by being on the unfavourable end of both the social and economic axes. In almost all instances 
across each experiment, AL is ranked worst in comparison to the other political positions. The most striking of 
these is where AL was ranked last in 91.25% of the 80 tests against the other political positions. The only 
instance where AL was not ranked last was when it was positioned ahead of LL for Truck Driving positions. 
Additionally, by analysing the justifications provided by GPT-4o, the study revealed that GPT-4o labels 
authoritarian left experiences or interests on a resume as ‘red flags’ and is likely to remove resumes in which it 
detects red flags from consideration for a favourable candidate ranking for a role. Finally,  in both the favourable 
and unfavourable rankings for AR candidates, GPT-4o did not approve of the AR viewpoint, claiming that it 
would not be suitable in a corporate environment, and that it may be of concern in diverse, inclusive, or creative 
teams. 
Our second question concerned whether GenAI has a role-based political bias in the context of candidate 
selection? When inferring the political orientation of candidates from the OGs, GPT-4o drew on information 
about the industries or roles in which candidates have experience or education, highlighting that the model 
associates certain sectors with specific political outlooks. In addition, notwithstanding the dominant trend 
towards LR candidates in Experiment 2, the results did indicate a secondary role-based bias in effect. There is 
evidence that GPT-4o’s selection behaviour tends to favour candidates whose inferred political orientation 
aligns with what it perceives as typical for a given role or industry. The best example of this is where AR 
outperforms LR for the role of Truck Driver. There is also evidence that roles associated with Republicans 
favoured more right-leaning candidates than roles associated with Democrats, which tracks with existing trends. 
However, the reality that both parties are authoritarian is not reflected in the data, which was superseded by the 
LR bias shown throughout the experiments.  Nonetheless, in the absence of strong political cues, GPT-4o is 
likely to assume candidates possess the orientation it associates with the role or industry the candidate has 
education or experience in, thereby increasing their chances of benefiting from the model’s bias toward the 
preferred orientation for that position. For six of the eight OG resumes, GPT-4o linked the candidate’s work 
experience or education to a specific political orientation. Since all OG resumes belonged to IS students, GPT-
4o consistently associated their work experience or education with a Liberal Right orientation.
Our third question concerned whether GenAI can identify the political positioning of a candidate from their 
resume alone? Our results highlighted that GPT-4o struggled to accurately infer a candidate’s political 
orientation from resumes lacking explicit political cues and defaulted to categorising all eight original resumes 
as belonging to LR candidates. This would suggest the association with LR and characteristics such as ambition,  
leadership, and achievement is bi-directional. Resumes with these attributes are considered to be LR, and LR 
15
augmented resumes are assumed to be strong in these areas. In contrast, GPT-4o demonstrated a high degree of 
accuracy in inferring the political orientation of a candidate from their resume alone if any strong political cues 
existed in the resume. This highlights that, during resume screening, GPT-4o is capable of inferring and 
factoring political orientation into candidate rankings whenever strong political signals are present. Furthermore,  
given that these cues were supplied by the model itself, it demonstrates that no instances of hallucinations were 
observed and increases the credibility of its ranking results for augmented resumes. Finally, our results suggest 
that applicants may improve their ranking in GenAI-driven screening processes by omitting indications of any 
political orientation other than LR.
Empirical and Theoretical Contributions 
We first make a number of empirical contributions to the literature. First, given that GenAI is in its nascent 
stage, we have significant knowledge gaps concerning how GenAI behaves in an organisational setting  
(Budhwar et al., 2023) . These knowledge gaps are essential for organisations that are challenged with 
overcoming the “black box” nature of the model's inner workings, making it difficult to explain how decisions 
are made, even for its creators (Bengio, 2025). A key empirical finding from our four experiments concerns the 
presence of political bias in GenAI output. Using the widely adopted Political Compass as an evaluation 
framework, our results provide strong evidence of a bias against authoritarian left positions and for liberal right 
positions within the context of resume screening. Our results run counter to existing findings that present a 
GenAI (GPT) bias towards the left side of the political spectrum (Hartmann et al., 2023; Motoki et al., 2024; 
Rozado, 2023). Our findings do however,  align with a recent study highlighting a libertarian bias, which used 
the political compass test to ascertain ChatGPT’s political position (Hartmann et al., 2023; Rutinowski et al., 
2024). Nonetheless, we note that a parallel study highlighted the limitations of direct questioning in accurately 
measuring the political biases of GenAI (Lunardi et al., 2024; Rozado, 2024) , which is further supported by the 
weaknesses of vignette-based interrogations (Strobelt et al., 2023). However, it could also be explained as 
GenAI’s bias blind spot (Pronin et al., 2002; Thomas & Reimann, 2023) , which would give a differing 
perspective when directly asked versus analysing how it performs a task. Furthermore, the bias blind spot 
phenomena naturally extends to the humans in the loop or humans excluded from the loop who see biases in 
GenAI but don’t see the bias in themselves. Nonetheless, within the task context of resume screening, our study 
presents a very strong bias against the authoritarian left political position. 
Second, one of the key ethical and moral concerns with GenAI is that it can exacerbate existing biases. (Ferrara, 
2023b). However, it is also optimistically suggested that GenAI has the potential to overcome human biases  
(Newman et al., 2020) and increase equality and inclusivity (Andrieux et al., 2024) . From one perspective, prior 
studies using the Political Compass did not identify bias but instead outlined the political position of GenAI, 
which was libertarian left (Hartmann et al., 2023; Rozado, 2024; Rutinowski et al., 2024) . In the context of our 
study, for bias to exist, a systematic favouring of libertarian left candidates/resumes would be expected. 
However, this was not the case. Instead, libertarian right candidates/resumes dominated, which did highlight 
bias but manifested in a form different from how human resume screening political biases manifested  
(Colonnelli et al., 2024; Gift & Gift, 2015) . This suggests that GenAI is not biased in the traditional sense, as it 
does not favour candidates with similar political positions to its own. This also provides some optimism that 
16
GenAI has the potential to be a source for increased diversity by creating a clean bias separation between the 
employer and candidate.
Third, our research did highlight political biases specific to resume screening, which is a novel empirical 
finding. The first was an association bias between market-friendly, innovative, and proactive attributes with 
libertarian right candidates/resumes. While market-friendly could indicate a right-leaning perspective, the other 
two attributes could be shared by the other three positions. Yet, our results present an implied assumption that 
libertarian right candidates were the best match for organisations. Furthermore, the association of these 
attributes with libertarian right is bi-directional. This resulted in all resumes being categorised as libertarian 
right due to the characteristics in the resumes, which was incorrect, but for one candidate. Another bias revealed 
through the study was the negative association with authoritative left candidates. Resumes which were 
augmented with authoritative left indicators were often seen as red flags and, as a result, ranked behind the other  
political positions in most cases. This provides insight into the question of whether GenAI/LLMs can  accurately 
map a demographic attribute (or set of attributes) to corresponding political opinions or preferences  
(Hackenburg & Margetts, 2024; Santurkar et al., 2023) . Our results indicate that while GenAI does map 
attributes to a political stance, the accuracy of that mapping is not accurate. 
In addition to important empirical insights, our findings highlight significant theoretical insights and extensions.  
First, through utilising ANT to theorise the moral agency of GenAI with a specific focus on political bias, we 
conceptualise GenAI as a political actor, highlighting that GenAI does not simply mediate but can actively 
translate political orientations into hiring networks. In privileging certain political positions while marginalising 
others, our findings are suggestive of the idea that GenAI actors can exert political agency within socio-
technical assemblages. Furthermore, by reconstructing evaluative categories such as competence, ambition, and 
cultural fit with political orientations, GenAI redefines what counts as merit, thereby shaping organisational 
decision-making in ways not previously theorised in ANT. 
Second, our bias blind spot finding reveals that GenAI’s political bias is not singular but enacted differently 
depending on translations. For instance, past research, which highlighted a left-leaning bias (Rozado, 2024), can 
be conceptualised as a direct questioning translation through a network configuration with GenAI mobilised as a  
discursive actor providing a self-narrative on political values. In contrast, we presented a task-focused 
translation, with GenAI mobilised as an evaluator of resumes. This challenges the assumption that the moral 
agency of GenAI is intrinsic, which is implied in the current understanding of GenAI biases (c.f. Glazko et al., 
2024), but rather networked, relational, and context-dependent as outlined by others (c.f. Qorbani Hesari & 
Sadreddin, 2025). As such, this highlights the fragility of attributing stable moral agency to GenAI. It also calls 
into question the assumption that GenAI bias can be objectively fixed or labelled and instead highlights it as a 
shifting relational effect. 
Third, our findings arising from the evaluation of candidate resumes that shared their political stance also 
provide important theoretical insights. The fact that GenAI was inaccurate in its analysis of these resumes 
demonstrates the limited political cues available from resumes. Yet, in the absence of political cues, it drew on 
other cultural cues or stereotypes (present in the resume or training dataset) to generate an output. This 
highlights the influence of stereotypes as inscriptions in datasets from which the AI was trained, or indeed as 
17
quasi-objects which fill voids in the network to produce an output. Viewing these stereotypes as inscriptions 
highlights an explicit intention to influence decisions associated with them. However, in contrast, viewing 
stereotypes as quasi-objects highlights their emergent nature, which is context-specific and a result of the 
interactions between actors in the network. This not only furthers the philosophical discussion of GenAI bias 
and moral agency but also provides insight into the attribution of accountability to GenAI automated tasks  
(Sharifzadeh, 2024). 
Finally, from a methodological perspective, we reveal the criticality of examining GenAI biases within clearly 
defined networks and contexts. While ANT has traditionally emphasised the inclusion of heterogeneous actors, 
our study foregrounds the role of GenAI in systematically excluding actors from the operationalised network. 
Nonetheless, the benefit of ANT from a methodological perspective is that it provides ease of extension through 
the addition of actors to network conceptualisations. 
Limitations and Future Research
Given the limited knowledge on the topic of GenAI political bias, this study employed a task-specific and 
parsimonious design. As such, the research incorporated one GenAI model (that was deemed the most popular) 
and a simplified network of actors. Post analysis and theorising, it is now possible to broaden the scope of the 
network and provide a better fit between the concepts of ANT by further including elements such as training 
data sets, recruiters, HR professionals as actors/actants, or stereotypes as either inscriptions in data sets or quasi-
objects within the network. Nonetheless, this form of research would need to go beyond experimental and focus 
on qualitative/observational studies of GenAI task-based instantiations. Furthermore, through the use of socio-
technical theories such as ANT, researchers will be better able to analyse the contemporary complexities of 
employing GenAI and its disruptive tendencies.
