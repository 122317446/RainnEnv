Okay, let’s analyze the invoices for compliance risks. Here’s a breakdown of the key findings, presented for easy understanding:

**Compliance Risk Summary**

| Risk Category          | Number of Invoices | Description                               |
|------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Supplier Risk**       | 2                  |  Invoices from both Brightline and Acme Tools were received, which is a mixed supplier base.  |
| **Late Payment Risk**    | 3                  | All invoices have due dates within 30-60 days of the invoice date.  This warrants close monitoring. |
| **Missing Fields**      | 0                  | All invoices contain all the required fields according to the provided template. |
| **Inconsistent Totals** | 0                  | All totals are consistent across invoices from the same supplier. |
| **Date/Payment Issues** | 0                  | All dates and payment terms align with standard practices. |

**Detailed Invoice Risk Flags (Based on the Input)**

*   **Brightline (INV-2684, INV-9938, INV-6617):**  Moderate Risk - Due dates fall within the 30-60 day window.  Requires closer monitoring for timely payment.
*   **Acme Tools (INV-6974, INV-3647, INV-2512):** Moderate Risk – Due dates fall within the 30-60 day window.  Requires closer monitoring for timely payment.
