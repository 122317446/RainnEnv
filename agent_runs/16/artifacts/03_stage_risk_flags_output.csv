**Invoice Compliance Risk Assessment**

**Overall Summary:** The invoices present a moderate level of risk primarily related to payment timing.  The mixed supplier base introduces some variability in risk profiles.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

| Risk Category          | Number of Invoices | Description                                                                | Severity |
|------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| **Supplier Diversity**  | 3                  | Invoices from Brightline, Acme Tools, and NovaParts are present.             | Low      |
| **Late Payment Risk**    | 6                  | All invoices have due dates within 30-60 days of the invoice date.           | Medium   |
| **Currency Risk**       | 6                  | All invoices are in EUR, potentially exposing the business to fluctuations. | Low      |
| **Payment Terms**       | 6                  | All invoices utilize "Net 30" payment terms.                               | Low      |
