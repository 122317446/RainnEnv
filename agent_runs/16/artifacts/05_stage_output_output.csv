**Compliance Summary:**

Across the five invoices, all suppliers (Brightline, Acme Tools, and NovaParts) adhere to “Net 30” payment terms. However, three invoices (INV-2684, INV-6974, and INV-9938) have due dates falling within the next 30 days, representing a potential risk of late payment.  There were no immediately obvious inconsistencies or missing fields within the provided invoice data.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Monitor Due Dates:** Closely track the due dates of INV-2684, INV-6974, and INV-9938 to ensure timely payment.
2.  **Supplier Communication:**  Maintain open communication with all suppliers regarding payment terms and potential delays.
3.  **Detailed Invoice Review:** Conduct a more granular review of invoice line items for unusual discrepancies or potential errors in the future.
