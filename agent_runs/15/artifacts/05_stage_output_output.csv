**Compliance Summary:**

Five invoices were reviewed. All invoices from Brightline and Acme Tools adhere to the specified payment terms of “Net 30”. One invoice from NovaParts has a total amount that is significantly lower than the subtotal and tax, potentially indicating an error.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **NovaParts Invoice Review:** Investigate the discrepancy in the NovaParts invoice (INV-2512) – a detailed review is needed to confirm the accuracy of the total amount.
2.  **Supplier Validation:** Verify the supplier details for all invoices to ensure data consistency.
3.  **Payment Monitoring:** Monitor payment due dates closely for all invoices, especially the Brightline and Acme Tools invoices, to ensure timely payment.
