**Compliance Summary and Next Steps**

Based on our analysis of invoice INV-4492 from Vertex Labs, we have identified two key compliance risks:

1. **Missing payment terms**: The explicit payment terms are missing from the invoice file, despite being inferred as "Net 30".
2. **Incomplete review due to lack of line item details**: Without detailed line items, a comprehensive total cannot be verified.

To address these issues, we recommend proceeding with caution and requesting clarification on the payment terms and providing additional information on the line items. This will enable us to conduct a more thorough review and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.
