**COMPLIANCE SUMMARY**

Based on the invoice provided (INV-6617), our compliance analysis has identified the following risks:

* Inconsistent Currency Usage: The invoice is denominated in EUR, but we have no evidence that this currency was specified for previous invoices.
* Late Payment Concerns: The due date for payment is 2026-02-13, which may not allow sufficient time for processing and payment.

**NEXT STEPS**

1. Verify the supplier's preferred currency to ensure consistency across future invoices.
2. Monitor the payment process to prevent late payments.
3. Review and adjust internal payment procedures as necessary to accommodate suppliers with varying payment terms.
