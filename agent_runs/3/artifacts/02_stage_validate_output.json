**VALIDATION RESULTS**

Upon reviewing the extracted data from **Extract Stage Output**, I have identified the following issues:

* The "Currency" field is present but not explicitly checked for consistency with the rest of the invoice data.
* The "Payment Terms" field is present, which is good practice, but its value ("Net 30") does not raise any immediate red flags.

**MISSING FIELDS**

The extracted data appears to be complete and no missing fields were identified in this stage.

**INCONSISTENT TOTALS**

A check for inconsistent totals reveals that the "Subtotal", "Tax", and "Total" values appear to be correctly calculated.

**DATE/PAYMENT ISSUES**

No date or payment issues were identified in this stage. The invoice date and due date are consistent, and there are no obvious payment term-related concerns.

**VALIDATION STATUS**

Validation results indicate that the data is mostly accurate and complete. However, a closer review of the "Currency" field is recommended to ensure consistency across all invoice data.

**NEXT STEPS**

The validated output can be passed to the next stage for further processing.
