Based on the current stage and input, I will proceed to create the JSON chart specification as instructed.

**GRAPH**

{
  "title": "Invoice Compliance Risk Chart",
  "labels": [
    "Risk Type",
    "Risk Severity"
  ],
  "values": [
    {
      "label": "Inconsistent Currency Usage",
      "value": 1
    },
    {
      "label": "Late Payment Concerns",
      "value": 0
    }
  ],
  "x_label": "Risk Type",
  "y_label": "Severity (Scale of 0-5)"
}

Please note that I have only included the identified risk in this chart, as instructed to follow the system primer and stage instructions. The output is suitable for input to the next stage.
