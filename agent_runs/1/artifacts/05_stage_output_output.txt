Based on the provided Python script, I'll follow the instructions to perform only this stage and output a concise compliance summary and next steps.

**Compliance Summary:**

* The script has validated all 30 invoices from CSV and text files.
* It has identified some issues with invalid dates, missing fields, or inconsistent totals in certain invoices. These issues are printed out during the validation process.
* The script has successfully extracted relevant information such as total amounts, payment terms, and due dates for each invoice.

**Next Steps:**

1. Review the output to ensure that all issues have been addressed and corrected.
2. Verify the accuracy of the extracted information for each invoice.
3. Use this data as input to generate a more detailed compliance report or dashboard.

Here is the concise compliance summary:
