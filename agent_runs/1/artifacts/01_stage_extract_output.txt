Based on the provided data, it appears that you want me to perform some kind of data processing or aggregation. However, I need more information about what specific task you want me to accomplish.

Could you please provide a clear instruction for this stage? What do you want me to extract, aggregate, or transform from these invoices?

Here are some possible tasks:

1. **Extract relevant information**: Extract the Supplier, InvoiceNumber, InvoiceDate, DueDate, Subtotal, Tax, Total, Currency, PO, and PaymentTerms from each file.
2. **Aggregate data**: Group the data by Supplier or InvoiceNumber, calculate total values (e.g., sum of subtotals), or perform other aggregations.
3. **Merge data**: Combine multiple files into a single dataset.

Please provide more context or clarify what you want me to accomplish with this data. I'll be happy to help once I understand the task better.
