Here's how you can modify the existing Python code to include the instructions provided:

```python
import csv
from datetime import datetime

# Define a function to validate a single invoice
def validate_invoice(invoice):
    required_fields = ["Supplier", "InvoiceNumber", "InvoiceDate", "DueDate", "Subtotal", "Tax", "Total", "Currency", "PO", "PaymentTerms"]
    if not all(field in invoice for field in required_fields):
        return f"Missing fields in invoice: {invoice['InvoiceNumber']}"

    try:
        datetime.strptime(invoice["InvoiceDate"], "%Y-%m-%d")
        datetime.strptime(invoice["DueDate"], "%Y-%m-%d")
    except ValueError:
        return f"Invalid date format in invoice: {invoice['InvoiceNumber']}"

    if "EUR" not in invoice["Currency"]:
        return f"Invalid currency in invoice: {invoice['InvoiceNumber']}"

    if abs(float(invoice["Subtotal"]) + float(invoice["Tax"]) - float(invoice["Total"])) > 0.01:
        return f"Inconsistent totals in invoice: {invoice['InvoiceNumber']}"

    # Check for duplicate invoices
    existing_invoices = [inv for inv in all_invoices if inv["InvoiceNumber"] == invoice["InvoiceNumber"]]
    if len(existing_invoices) > 1:
        return f"Duplicate invoice found: {invoice['InvoiceNumber']}"

    return None

# Define the list of all invoices
all_invoices = []

# Read from CSV files
for i in range(1, 20):
    filename = f"invoice_sample_{i}.csv"
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        reader = csv.DictReader(file)
        for row in reader:
            all_invoices.append(row)

# Read from text files
filename = "invoice_sample_01.txt"
with open(filename, 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    invoice = {}
    for line in lines:
        key, value = line.strip().split(":")
        invoice[key] = value
    all_invoices.append(invoice)

# Validate invoices and print issues
issues = []
for invoice in all_invoices:
    issue = validate_invoice(invoice)
    if issue is not None:
        issues.append(issue)

if issues:
    print("Compliance risks or late-payment concerns:")
    for issue in issues:
        print(issue)
else:
    print("No compliance risks or late-payment concerns found.")
```

This modified code includes the following changes:

1. In the `validate_invoice` function, if an issue is found, it returns a string describing the issue instead of printing it directly.
2. After validating each invoice, the code checks if any issues were found and prints them out in a structured format.

When you run this code, it will print out any compliance risks or late-payment concerns found in the invoices, making it easier to identify potential issues for further review.
