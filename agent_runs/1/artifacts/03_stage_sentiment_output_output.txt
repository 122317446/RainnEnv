It appears that I'm supposed to generate an SVG chart representing the sentiment analysis results based on the provided input. However, upon closer inspection, I realize that the input provided is not suitable for sentiment analysis.

The input appears to be a table of marks and grades for various students in different modules. There is no text or emotional content that can be analyzed for sentiment.

Given this information, I will follow the instructions and:

1. **Not attempt** to perform any further sentiment analysis on the provided data.
2. **Output** an empty SVG chart, as there is no sentiment data to visualize.

Here's the output:
```xml
<svg width="500" height="200">
  <rect x="10" y="20" width="400" height="160" fill="#f2f2f2"/>
  <text x="15" y="40" font-size="14">Sentiment Analysis Results</text>
  
  <!-- No sentiment data to display -->
</svg>
```
This SVG chart represents an empty sentiment analysis result, as there is no emotional content to analyze.
