Abstract: This paper (2024) investigates decision support dashboards in healthcare in the context of Health Informatics. We propose a workflow combining EHR, risk scoring, explainability. Method: Topic modelling (BERTopic) + qualitative coding. Dataset: Public benchmark dataset (n=50,000) plus internal holdout set. Metrics: NPV, PPV, sensitivity, specificity.

1 Introduction: We motivate the problem with operational constraints and stakeholder needs.

2 Methodology: Topic modelling (BERTopic) + qualitative coding. We report training details and ablations.

3 Dataset: Public benchmark dataset (n=50,000) plus internal holdout set. Preprocessing includes de-duplication and missing value handling.

4 Evaluation: Metrics used: NPV, PPV, sensitivity, specificity. We compare against baseline and variants.

5 Results: Benefits are concentrated in small SMEs; larger orgs show marginal gains.

6 Limitations: Evaluation omits latency and operational cost constraints.

7 Conclusion: We summarise findings and propose future work directions.
